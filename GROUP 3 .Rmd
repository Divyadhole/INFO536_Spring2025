## Role 1: Group and prepare data by attack type.

```{r}


```

## Role 2: Count the number of each attack type.

```{r}
# Grouping by primary attack type and summarizing attack counts
attack_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(attacktype1_txt) %>%
  summarise(
    total_attacks = n(),
    avg_kills = mean(nkill, na.rm = TRUE),  # Average number of fatalities per attack type
    avg_wounded = mean(nwound, na.rm = TRUE)  # Average number of wounded per attack type
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_attacks))  # Sort in descending order

# View summary
print(attack_summary)


```

## Role 3: Visualize the most common attack types using a bar chart.
